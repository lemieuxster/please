Please
======

Seriously, I've never used Ruby before. Don't judge.


Usage
-----

Use please to manage aliases in terminal so that

    tail -f /Users/username/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash\ Player/Logs/flashlog.txt

becomes

    please tail flash log

SO MUCH EASIER.


Commands
--------
--add "new alias" "command" "working directory"(optional)
    this adds a new alias to please to handle the command that will work out of the working directory
    for example --add "tail flash log" "tail -f /Users/username/Library/Preferences/Macromedia/Flash\ Player/Logs/flashlog.txt"
    or --add "run some script" "scriptName.sh" "/dir/to/script/"

--del "new alias"
    this removes the alias

--list
    this shows a list of aliases

--help
    shows help


Installation
------------

I could make this a "gem" or "something" but for now...

    sudo cp please.rb /usr/local/bin/please && sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/please

USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

HUZZAH!


Secret Hints
------------

When creating a new alias that requires arguments, you can use this syntax:
please --add "my new alias" "echo {one} {two} {three} {four}"

As this alias is executed, you will be propted by stdin to provide values for each variable, like so
one: Uno
two: Dos
three: Tres
four: Cuatro

And the output would like like this
Uno Dos Tres Cuatro

Because the command that was run was echo Uno Dos Tres Cuatro.
